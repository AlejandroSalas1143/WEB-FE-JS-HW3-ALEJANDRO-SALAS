                <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a dynamic, interpreted, high-level programming language used primarily to create
                    interactivity in web pages. It was originally designed to run in browsers and allow web pages to be
                    more
                    dynamic and interactive, but today it is also used on the server (with Node.js) and in a wide
                    variety of
                    applications outside the browser, such as in mobile, desktop and even IoT devices. <br>
                    <br>
                    JavaScript is a prototype-based, object-oriented language and supports programming paradigms such as
                    functional and imperative programming. It plays a key role in web development alongside HTML and
                    CSS,
                    forming the core of web technologies.

                <h2>What is Javascript Asynchronous?</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a single-threaded language, which means that it can only execute one task at a time in
                    its main execution cycle. However, many tasks (such as server requests, database access, or timers)
                    take time to complete and can block the flow of the program if not handled properly. Asynchronous
                    operations in JavaScript allow the language to handle long-running tasks without stopping the
                    execution of the rest of the program. <br>
                    <br>
                    These tasks are executed in the background and, when ready, are reintroduced into the main execution
                    cycle (through the event loop, which we will see later).

                <h2>What is Callback?</h2>
                <p>
                    A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is invoked once the
                    main operation is complete. Callbacks are essential for handling asynchronous code in JavaScript, as
                    they allow you to execute a function when a long task finishes (such as reading a file or making an
                    HTTP request). <br>
                    <br>
                    Callbacks can be challenging to read and maintain when there are many nested asynchronous
                    operations, a phenomenon known as callback hell, where the code becomes difficult to follow.

                        function getData(callback) {
                            console.log('Getting data...');
                          
                            setTimeout(() => {
                                let data = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
                                callback(data);
                            }, 2000);

                <h2>What is Promise?</h2>
                <p>
                    Promises were introduced in ECMAScript 6 to solve some of the problems of intensive callback usage,
                    such as the aforementioned “callback hell”. A Promise is an object that represents the eventual
                    result (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. It can be in one of three states: <br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Pending (pending): The operation has not yet completed or failed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fulfilled: The operation has completed successfully.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rejected: The operation has failed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Promises allow to better manage the control flow and chain multiple asynchronous operations without
                    deep nesting of functions.

                <h2>What is Async/Await?</h2>
                <p>
                    async and await were introduced in ECMAScript 2017 (ES8) as an evolution of Promises handling,
                    allowing to write asynchronous code in a simpler and more readable way. async is a keyword that
                    defines an asynchronous function, which always returns a Promise. await is a keyword used inside an
                    async function to wait for a Promise to be resolved or rejected, so the code can be written in a
                    “linear” way, as if it were synchronous. <br>
                    <br>
                    This makes the code easier to understand, without the need to use multiple then() or handle errors
                    with catch().

                <h2>What is Event Loop?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Event Loop is a fundamental mechanism in JavaScript that handles asynchronous operations and
                    concurrency. Since JavaScript is single-threaded, the Event Loop is responsible for constantly
                    checking for pending tasks to execute. When the synchronous code in the main stack has finished, the
                    Event Loop takes tasks from the message queue (where asynchronous operations, such as Promises or
                    callbacks, are placed) and executes them. <br>
                    <br>
                    The Event Loop allows JavaScript to continue responding to events or user interactions while waiting
                    for an asynchronous operation to finish.
